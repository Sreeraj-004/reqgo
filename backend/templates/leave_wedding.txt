I am writing to request leave from {{from_date}} to {{to_date}} as I need to attend a family wedding.

This occasion requires my presence, and I will make all necessary arrangements to ensure that my academic responsibilities are managed effectively.

I kindly request you to consider my application and grant me leave for the mentioned period.
