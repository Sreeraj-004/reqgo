I am writing to request permission to wear color dress from {{from_date}} to {{to_date}} as my uniform has been damaged and I am awaiting a replacement.

I understand the importance of maintaining the dress code, and I assure you that I will wear appropriate formal attire during this period. I have already initiated the process to obtain a new uniform and expect to receive it soon.

I kindly request you to grant me permission to wear color dress temporarily until my new uniform is provided. I will ensure that I maintain a professional appearance and adhere to all other dress code requirements.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
