I am writing to request permission to attend classes from {{from_date}} to {{to_date}} without my ID card.

I have misplaced my ID card and am in the process of obtaining a replacement. I understand the importance of proper identification on campus and assure you that I will carry alternative identification documents during this period.

I kindly request you to grant me permission to attend classes without my ID card for the mentioned duration. I will ensure that I obtain a new ID card at the earliest opportunity.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
